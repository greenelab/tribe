                    Tribe supports most common identifiers. Currently that means
                    we support Symbol, Ensembl, Entrez, HGNC, HPRD, MGI, MIM,
                    SGD, UniProtKB, TAIR, WormBase, RGD, FLYBASE, ZFIN, Vega,
                    IMGT/GENE-DB, and miRBase. If there's something that we

                <p> Tribe also offers a service that lets you translate gene IDs between different gene identifiers programmatically. This example uses the same <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests library</a> as the example above to do this.</p>

<pre>
import requests

# Define where Tribe is located.
TRIBE_URL = "http://tribe.greenelab.com"

# Enter the type of gene IDs you are translating to and from and fill up
# the 'gene_list' list with the genes you want translated in the payload parameters.
# In this case, we will use the following 3 Entrez IDs to translate to Symbols, 
# but 'from_id' and 'to_id' parameters could be any identifier we support.
# We can also include an 'organism' parameter and the name of the species we want
# (this is useful when giving Tribe gene symbols that could belong to different species). 

gene_list = [6279, 1363, 56892]
payload = {'from_id': 'Entrez', 'to_id': 'Symbol', 'gene_list': gene_list, 'organism': 'Homo sapiens'} 

r = requests.post(TRIBE_URL + '/api/v1/gene/xrid_translate', data=payload)

# The response from tribe is a json object.
# The requests library can convert this to
# a python dictionary.
result_dictionary = r.json()

# Print the results of this request:
for gene_query, search_result in result_dictionary.iteritems():
    print(gene_query + ": " + str(search_result))

# Running the above code prints:
6279: [u'S100A8']
not_found: []
1363: [u'CPE']
56892: [u'C8orf4']

# As you can see, Tribe returns a results list for each gene that is queried,
# as well as a list of gene IDs that were entered but were not found.
