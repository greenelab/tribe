            The idea of collaborative data mining is built into Tribe. Work with
            your partners to store findings in one place. Then use those collections
            to mine large-scale data compendia.

            Tribe's permissions system allows you to control how your collections are
            used. Collections can be public or private, and private collections are
            only shared with people that you specifically authorize.

            Tribe provides detailed versioning information storing not just
            what you know but also how you got there. Fork public resources and
            add your own findings to quickly build your knowledgebase.

            Tribe's API returns well formed JSON objects, so support for the API
            exists in the languages that you already use. For example, pythonistas
            can use the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests 
            library</a> for easy access.

            Tribe's API was designed by computational biologists for computational
            biologists. The Tribe server handles gene name mapping, so all collections
            can be returned with the gene identifiers that you need.

            Link your webserver with Tribe to make it immediately available to
            the broader research community. Users can access their own Tribe collections
            on your server using the <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2</a> protocol.
