    <strong>Seamlessly mine data across bioinformatics systems.</strong>
    Tribe stores the findings of your research as collections of genes,
    also called  gene sets, so you can keep track of them and send them
    directly to other webservers for analyses. It knows the
    different gene identifiers (e.g. Entrez and Ensembl) available
    so that any webserver or tool in your pipeline can request
    that identifier for your collection.
    <br>
    <br>
    Tribe also keeps track of the different versions of your
    collections as you edit them, and saves annotations you make to each
    version so you can go back and reproduce your analyses.

            The idea of collaborative data mining is built into Tribe. Work with
            your partners to store findings in one place. Then use those collections
            to mine large-scale data compendia.

            Tribe's API returns well formed JSON objects, so support for the API
            exists in the languages that you already use. For example, pythonistas
            can use the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests 
            library</a> for easy access.

            Tribe's permissions system allows you to control how your collections are
            used. Collections can be public or private, and private collections are
            only shared with people that you specifically authorize.

            Tribe's API was designed by computational biologists for computational
            biologists. The Tribe server handles gene name mapping, so all collections
            can be returned with the gene identifiers that you need.
