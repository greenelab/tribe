Tribe Overview
=========================

Seamlessly mine data across bioinformatics systems
---------------------------------------------------

For biologists, Tribe puts literature search and experimental results to work mining large data compendia. For bioinformatics researchers, Tribe allows biologists to use your webservers seamlessly as part of an analytical pipeline.


Work with collaborators
---------------------------
The idea of collaborative data mining is built into Tribe. Work with your partners to store findings in one place. Then use those collections to mine large-scale data compendia. 


Write simple code.
-------------------
Tribe's API returns well formed JSON objects, so support for the API exists in the languages that you already use. For example, pythonistas can use the requests library for easy access. Tribe's API was designed by computational biologists for computational biologists. The Tribe server handles gene name mapping, so all collections can be returned with the gene identifiers that you need. 


Control your collections
--------------------------
Tribe's permissions system allows you to control how your collections are used. Collections can be public or private, and private collections are only shared with people that you specifically authorize.


Keep your history
--------------------
Tribe provides detailed versioning information storing not just what you know but also how you got there. Fork public resources and add your own findings to quickly build your knowledgebase. 


Link with Tribe
-----------------
Link your webserver with Tribe to make it immediately available to the broader research community. Users can access their own Tribe collections on your server using the OAuth2 protocol.
