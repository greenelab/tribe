Glossary of Tribe terms

    Geneset/Collection
        We use the terms Geneset and Collection interchangeably. A
        geneset/collection is a group of genes that are connected (optionally
        through publications) to user defined processes and pathways.

    Tags
        Tags are keywords associated with genesets/collections that can be
        added by users. Users can then filter genesets to only retrieve the
        ones that have a certain tag (i.e. 'adipose tissue').

    Version
        Genesets/Collections are version-controlled in Tribe, meaning that
        users can update them as many times as they want (changing the
        contained genes/publications), and Tribe will keep a history of all of
        the versions a user saves. This allows for reproducible science, as
        users can go back and run an analysis using any previous saved version
        of their geneset/collection.
